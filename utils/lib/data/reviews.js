        name:'Liam', content:'Had a delicious lunch at work yesterday, My Boss and I both had boneless chicken curry in a roti skin with an extra roti skin to dip, it was warm, fresh and massive. For the price you pay the portions are great, and you can tell they put love into the food(even on uber eats orders, which is rare). The hot sauce was more hot than flavourful, but all around it was a great lunch',
