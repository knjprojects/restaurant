FR has a personal commitment in that they will only serve same-day, not leftover food as their pledge of quality to the customer, and that is something that should be respected. one star knocked off for their sometimes inconsistent and unposted hours. if you're unsure, phone in to confirm the store is open, that's what i always do. november 10, 2021: updated review add-on -FR continues to show why imo they are the heavyweight champions (along with caribbean-canadian restaurant on the mountain) of the city of hamilton, when it comes to price relative to value, quality and portion size, and menu options for the caribbean food segment. -my favorite (and recommended) items are the chicken/beef curry rotis, jerk chicken with rice, doubles, and the patties are fantastic also. üî• the way FR makes their food, it feels like they are cooking directly in your kitchen. you can also pick curry chicken or beef with rice and not go wrong either. üíØ -nicholas (son of kevin/christine) is doing a fantastic job helping in the store. he is warm, welcoming and on point with the customers. üíô-drawback of the FR is very limited parking as the store is located on a very busy street. bottom line: i will continue to support FR and would recommend it to others. they are honest, hard working passionate people. great food, portions, quality. keep up the great work! üíØ ",

        name:'Liam', content:'Had a delicious lunch at work yesterday, My Boss and I both had boneless chicken curry in a roti skin with an extra roti skin to dip, it was warm, fresh and massive. For the price you pay the portions are great, and you can tell they put love into the food(even on uber eats orders, which is rare). The hot sauce was more hot than flavourful, but all around it was a great lunch',

        content:`This is a tiny shop off bay and king, but there is a lot of flavour! Ordered the doubles, boneless chicken roti and goat roti. The roti was flavourful, moist, the gravy was amazing. I didn't love the doubles, it needed more depth. I also did not like the hot sauce on the side - I felt it was too 1 note. Just hot, no flavour. Rotis were really good though!`,

Some other places use too much potato compared to the amount of meat or pumpkin or chana, but here you get all the flavours. This tiny little place has a huge heart, and it's on my list of places to go regularly.",

The owner is super nice, cooks everything fresh, the food is tender and full of flavour, and I always leave satisfied. I am a huge fan of curry and in my opinion this is the place to go if you want curry. The portions are always great and I am never left feeling hungry. Worth eating here, you honestly won't regret it! 100/10 recommend!!",
